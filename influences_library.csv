Key: use repetitive patterns rather than constantly developing melodies. Works beautifully solo (pure single-influence) or layered with minimal percussion/pads.

For programming: extract the instrumental focus and modal harmony, use vintage production warmth (tape saturation), avoid the vocal-driven protest songs. Works as pure acoustic or with subtle electronic foundation.",,Unexplored
83,Acoustic Instruments,Spanish/Flamenco Guitar (Texture Only),"Rasgueado textures (as background rhythm), melodic arpeggios, passionate tone but restrained dynamics, nylon string warmth, modal scales","Traditional flamenco performance (too demanding), castanets, palmas (hand clapping), cante jondo vocals, virtuosic solos","CRITICAL: Use Spanish/flamenco TECHNIQUES and AESTHETIC, not traditional flamenco music. Traditional flamenco demands attention through dramatic dynamics and virtuosity. Instead: extract the rasgueado rhythm as gentle texture, use modal scales for exotic color, apply passionate tone with restrained volume. Think ""Spanish guitar influence"" not ""flamenco performance."" Works beautifully layered with electronic elements (flamenco house fusion) or pure acoustic. Artists like Paco de Lucía's contemplative pieces show flamenco guitar in meditative contexts.",,Unexplored
84,Genre Influences,British Folk-Rock (George Harrison/Beatles Acoustic),"Bright major key acoustic guitar with capo, melodic arpeggios, optimistic mood, Abbey Road production warmth, clean vintage 1960s sound, sunshine aesthetic, uplifting without being cheesy","Recognizable Beatles melodies (copyright + demands attention), vocal harmonies, ""na na na"" hooks, overly sentimental production, psychedelic excess (sitars, backwards tapes)","""Here Comes the Sun"" represents optimistic acoustic folk-rock perfect for Morning Warmup or Midday Refresh - bright major key guitar creates sunshine energy without being aggressive. Key: Use the FEEL (optimistic, uplifting, bright) not the specific melody. Capo-ed acoustic guitar, clean production, melodic but not memorable (avoid earworms).

Timbaland and The Neptunes created polished R&B/hip-hop production perfect for background: programmed drums (not live), sub bass that grounds you physically, spacious minimal arrangements. Key: Extract the GROOVE and PRODUCTION aesthetic, not vocals. Use syncopated rhythms (not straight four-on-floor), clean digital production (not vintage warmth), confident pocket. Works beautifully for Deep Focus Block 2 - the bass weight and minimal swagger provide sustained energy without aggression. Instrumental versions only.",,Unexplored
86,Genre Influences,Classic Hip-Hop Production (J Dilla/Pete Rock),"Boom bap drums, jazz/soul samples, head-nodding groove, swing quantization, dusty vinyl texture, warm analog production, confident pocket, off-kilter timing (J Dilla feel)","Rap vocals, scratching (too foreground), aggressive battle rap energy, overly complex sampling, recognizable samples demanding attention","J Dilla, Pete Rock, and DJ Premier created the golden age hip-hop sound - boom bap drums with jazz/soul samples, swing quantization for human feel, confident head-nodding pocket. The ""Dilla feel"" (slightly off-grid timing) creates hypnotic groove perfect for programming. Key: Use instrumental hip-hop aesthetic - the drums, bass, and sample textures without vocals. Warm analog production (not clean digital), vinyl crackle, dusty warmth. Works for Morning Warmup or Deep Focus Block 1 - the swing and jazz samples provide sophisticated groove. Think Nujabes, DJ Shadow instrumental work.",,Unexplored
87,Genre Influences,Euphoric Dance/Pop (Empowerment Anthems),"Uplifting major key progressions, piano house stabs, four-on-floor drive, empowering energy, celebratory mood, triumphant chords, building energy without dramatic drops, joyful euphoria","Vocals (use instrumental versions), EDM drops that demand attention, cheese factor, overly commercial production, aggressive club energy, recognizable pop hooks","""Finally"" by CeCe Peniston, ""Titanium"" by David Guetta, and classic house anthems represent euphoric, empowering energy missing from the library. This fills the gap between meditative calm and aggressive energy - music that actively LIFTS mood and energy. Use for Midday Refresh when you need emotional/energy boost, or Morning Warmup for empowering start. Key: Extract the FEELING (euphoric, triumphant, empowering) not the vocals. Piano house stabs, uplifting chord progressions, major key celebration. Build energy gradually without dramatic drops. Think instrumental house anthems, dance-pop production without the pop vocals. The euphoria should be sustained and hypnotic, not attention-demanding. Different from deep house (too minimal) or tropical house (too laid-back) - this is celebratory and empowering.",,Unexplored
