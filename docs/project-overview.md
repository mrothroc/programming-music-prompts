# Project Overview

## Purpose

Generate a neuroscience-informed library of instrumental focus music for programming work using Suno AI.

## Core Methodology

Music prompts are engineered to induce specific brainwave states:

- **Theta-Gamma Coupling**: Deep focus (Flow state)
- **Alpha Boost**: Novelty refresh (Combat habituation)
- **Theta-Alpha Transition**: Gentle awakening
- **Beta Suppression + Alpha**: Fatigue combat
- **Alpha to Theta Descent**: Wind-down (Parasympathetic shift)

## Key Innovation

Music for programming should be **textural architecture** (sonic scaffolding for cognition) rather than foreground listening. The goal is to create background soundscapes that support different types of programming work throughout the day.

### Design Principles

1. **No melodic leads** - Melodies demand conscious attention
2. **Repetitive patterns** - Create predictable sonic scaffolding
3. **Instrumental only** - No lyrics to compete with verbal working memory
4. **Textural instruments** - Atmospheric layers over foreground elements
5. **BPM matching brain states** - Tempo influences neural entrainment

## Scope

- **70 total prompts**:
  - 66 prompts organized by workday time blocks
  - 4 BONUS prompts for edge cases (debugging, creative work, refactoring, late-night)
- **Each prompt generates 2 versions** in Suno
- **Quality curation**: Keep excellent versions, discard mediocre ones

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 70 prompts generated in Suno
2. ✅ Genetic diversity maintained (no incestual cloning)
3. ✅ User ratings captured for excellent prompts
4. 🔄 Extract common patterns from ⭐ rated prompts
5. 🔄 Create "best of" playlist for each time block
