# Project Overview

## Purpose

Generate a library of instrumental focus music for programming work using Suno AI, informed by research showing music helps programmers enter flow states and write better code.

## Research Foundation

Lesiuk (2005) found that programmers who listened to music while working wrote better code and completed tasks faster than those in silence. The music helped them enter flow state, improved mood, and maintained optimal arousal. Without music, code quality was poorest and tasks took longest.

This project applies that finding by creating music matched to different times of day—because wrong music at the wrong time adds stress instead of helping.

## Core Methodology

Music prompts target specific cognitive states appropriate to time of day:

- **Morning Warmup** (92-102 BPM): Gentle awakening, theta-alpha transition
- **Deep Focus Block 1** (95-112 BPM): Building flow state, theta-gamma coupling
- **Deep Focus Block 2** (96-108 BPM): Sustained focus, fighting fatigue
- **Midday Refresh** (108-122 BPM): Re-energize, alpha boost
- **Late Afternoon Push** (95-122 BPM): Final sprint, beta suppression
- **Evening Wind-Down** (85-95 BPM): Release, parasympathetic shift

## Key Innovation

Music for programming should be **textural architecture** (sonic scaffolding for cognition) rather than foreground listening. The goal is to create background soundscapes that support different types of programming work throughout the day.

### Design Principles

1. **No melodic leads** - Melodies demand conscious attention
2. **Repetitive patterns** - Create predictable sonic scaffolding
3. **Instrumental only** - No lyrics to compete with verbal working memory
4. **Textural instruments** - Atmospheric layers over foreground elements
5. **BPM matching brain states** - Tempo influences neural entrainment

## Scope

- **130 total prompts** organized by workday time blocks:
  - Morning Warmup: 32 prompts
  - Deep Focus Block 1: 21 prompts
  - Deep Focus Block 2: 34 prompts
  - Midday Refresh: 11 prompts
  - Late Afternoon Push: 16 prompts
  - Evening Wind-Down: 12 prompts
  - Edge cases: 4 prompts (debugging, creative work, refactoring, late-night)
- **87 musical influences** curated across 5 categories
- **Each prompt generates 2 versions** in Suno—keep the best, discard mediocre ones

## Current Status

- ✅ All 130 prompts generated and catalogued
- ✅ Genetic diversity maintained through 50/30/20 algorithm
- ✅ 40 prompts tested and rated (30%)
  - 4 Excellent (3%)
  - 14 Very Good (11%)
  - 15 Pretty Good (12%)
  - 4 Okay (3%)
  - 3 Bad (2%)
- ✅ Key learnings documented (jazz-dominant hybrids work, avoid thumpy kicks, contextual energy matching matters)
- 🔄 90 prompts remain untested
