## Music and Programming Performance

### Primary Studies

**Lesiuk, T. (2005).** The effect of music listening on work performance. *Psychology of Music*, 33(2), 173-191.
https://doi.org/10.1177/0305735605050650

**Study Design:**
- Field study with computer information systems developers (software developers)
- 5-week duration in actual work environments
- Compared work performance with and without music

**Key Findings:**
- Quality of work was **lowest with no music**
- Time-on-task was **longest when music was removed** (music increased efficiency)
- Positive affect (mood) was **lowest without music**
- Evidence of learning curve: developers learned to use music effectively for mood alteration
- Music helped developers enter flow state and maintain optimal arousal

**Relevance to This Project:**
This is the most directly relevant study for programming music. It demonstrates with actual software developers in real work environments that music improves both code quality and task completion speed. The finding that music helps enter flow state validates the approach of using music to target specific cognitive states.

### Programmer Brainwave Studies

**Ishida, T., & Uwano, H. (2019).** Time Series Analysis of Programmer's EEG for Debug State Classification. *Companion of the 3rd International Conference on Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming (Programming '19)*, April 1–4, 2019, Genova, Italy. ACM.
https://doi.org/10.1145/3328433.3328459

**Study Design:**
- 5 programmers performing 16 debugging tasks (8 easy, 8 difficult)
- EEG recorded at 256Hz using NeXus-10 device
- Analyzed alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) wave power during code comprehension

**Key Findings:**
- **Successful code comprehension significantly increased both α (p=0.002) and β (p<0.001) waves**
- Failed attempts showed no significant alpha/beta changes
- Alpha wave increases appeared within 16-20 seconds in successful comprehension
- Beta waves increased during both success and failure, but alpha distinguished outcomes

**Relevance:**
Demonstrates that successful programming cognition requires sustained alpha wave activity (relaxed focus) combined with beta activity (active thinking). Directly validates targeting alpha-frequency states with music during programming sessions.

https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072338

**Study Design:**
- 26 programmers performing code comprehension tasks
- High-resolution EEG (64 channels, 1000 Hz sampling)
- Three complexity levels validated against NASA-TLX subjective ratings
- Eye tracking synchronized with EEG data

**Key Findings:**
- **96.5% accuracy distinguishing code complexity using EEG**
- **Theta, Alpha, and Beta bands showed highest discriminative power**
- Frontal (Fz, F2) and parietal (Pz) electrodes most informative
- Key biomarkers: θ/(β+α) ratio (F2), θ/α ratio (Pz)
- Software complexity metrics did NOT match human-perceived difficulty
- Evidence of cognitive load saturation at high complexity

**Relevance:**
Gold-standard validation that Theta, Alpha, and Beta frequencies are the most relevant brainwave states for programming cognition. Confirms that frontal-parietal brain regions drive programming performance. Supports targeting these specific frequency bands with music interventions.

**Yeh, M. K.-C., Yan, Y., Zhuang, Y., & DeLong, L. A. (2021).** Identifying program confusion using electroencephalogram measurements. *Behaviour & Information Technology*.
https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2021.1933182

**Study Design:**
- 14 programmers (10 analyzed) reading confusing C code patterns
- EEG measured alpha (8-13 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands
- Frontal (F3, F4, F7, F8) and parietal (P7, P8) regions monitored
- Measured Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) as cognitive load indicator

**Key Findings:**
- **Frontal region alpha band strongly correlated with cognitive workload** during programming
- Reaction time significantly correlated with ERD values (r = -0.76 to -0.94)
- Alpha desynchronization = higher cognitive demand
- Self-reported difficulty did NOT reliably predict actual cognitive load

**Relevance:**
Confirms that frontal alpha activity is critical for programming comprehension. Music designed to support alpha synchronization during breaks or enhance alpha power during work may reduce cognitive fatigue. Validates that objective biomarkers (not self-awareness) should guide music selection.

## Flow States and Brainwaves

**Nakamura, J., & Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2002).** The concept of flow. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), *Handbook of Positive Psychology* (pp. 89-105). Oxford University Press.

**Key Contributions:**
- Seminal definition of flow state characteristics
- Flow as intense attentional focus on task at hand
- Characteristics include loss of self-consciousness, merging of action and awareness
- Addresses flow across sports, art, and work domains
- Emphasizes interactionist perspective: flow emerges from person-environment interaction

**Relevance:**
Provides theoretical framework for understanding "the zone" that programmers experience during deep work.

**Katahira, K., Yamazaki, Y., Yamaoka, C., Ozaki, H., Nakagawa, S., & Nagata, N. (2018).** EEG correlates of the flow state: A combination of increased frontal theta and moderate frontocentral alpha rhythm in the mental arithmetic task. *Frontiers in Psychology*, 9, 300.
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00300

**Study Design:**
- 16 participants (10 males, 6 females)
- Task: Mental arithmetic problems at varying difficulty levels
- Three conditions: Boredom, Flow, Overload
- EEG measurement during task execution

**Key Findings:**
- **Increased frontal theta** in Flow and Overload conditions (vs Boredom)
- **Moderate frontocentral alpha** that increased gradually with task difficulty
- Theta possibly related to high cognitive control and immersion
- Moderate alpha suggests working memory load was not excessive
- EEG activities correlated with self-reported flow experience

**Relevance:**
While the study used mental arithmetic (not programming), the cognitive demands (working memory, logical processing) are similar. Provides empirical evidence that flow states have measurable brainwave correlates: increased theta + moderate alpha.

**Note:** Original README incorrectly stated this study examined "programming tasks." It actually studied mental arithmetic tasks.

## Brainwave Entrainment

**Askarpour, H., Mirzaee, F., Habibi, F., & Pourfridoni, M. (2024).** Binaural Beats' Effect on Brain Activity and Psychiatric Disorders: A Literature Review. *The Open Public Health Journal*, 17, e18749445332258.
https://doi.org/10.2174/0118749445332258241008103504

**Study Design:**
- Literature review following PRISMA guidelines
- Synthesized findings from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar
- Focus on binaural beats effects on memory, cognition, anxiety, depression, and sleep

**Key Findings:**
- **Beta-frequency binaural beats** most effective for enhancing long-term memory
- **40 Hz binaural beats** significantly improved cognition
- **Gamma-frequency beats** enhance cognitive flexibility and divergent thinking
- **Alpha-frequency beats** (8-13 Hz) maintain alert relaxation, increased frontal/central alpha power
- **Theta-frequency beats** show mixed results (some enhancement, some impairment)
- Optimal exposure: 5-30 minutes for behavioral effects
- **Critical limitation: "Significant inconsistencies remain across various studies"**

**Relevance:**
Provides theoretical support for frequency-specific cognitive effects, but evidence is mixed. Beta (13-30 Hz) for concentration, alpha (8-13 Hz) for relaxed alertness, gamma (30-100 Hz) for cognitive flexibility. However, this reviews binaural beats (auditory illusions requiring headphones), not musical tempo, so findings may not directly transfer to instrumental music at specific BPMs.

**Huang, T. L., & Charyton, C. (2008).** A comprehensive review of the psychological effects of brainwave entrainment. *Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine*, 14(5), 38-50.

**Study Design:**
- Systematic review searching OVID Medline (1950-2007), PsychInfo (1806-2007), Scopus
- 20 studies selected examining rhythmic stimuli effects on psychological outcomes

**Key Findings:**
- Benefits found for: cognitive functioning deficits, stress, pain, headaches/migraines, PMS, behavioral problems
- Brainwave entrainment (BWE) shown to be an effective therapeutic tool
- Discussed various entrainment methods including binaural beats, isochronic tones, visual entrainment
- More research needed to establish optimal parameters

**Relevance:**
Provides theoretical foundation that rhythmic auditory stimuli can influence brainwave patterns. However, most research uses binaural beats (headphones required), not instrumental music at specific tempos.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2017.07.010

**Study Design:**
- Two experiments: (1) 30-min EEG recording during 40-Hz binaural beat listening, (2) word list recall task before/after 20-min listening
- Measured both neural activity and cognitive performance

**Key Findings:**
- Frontal, temporal, and central brain regions activated within 15 minutes
- **Enhanced working memory**: increased recalled words in working memory portion of list
- **Induced gamma and beta oscillations** at temporal and frontal regions
- Emotional states changed consistent with induced neural oscillations

**Relevance:**
Demonstrates that auditory stimulation can enhance working memory—critical for programming. However, used binaural beats (40 Hz gamma frequency), not instrumental music.

## Music Type and Cognitive States

**El Sayed, B. B., Basheer, M. A., Shalaby, M. S., El Habashy, H. R., & Elkholy, S. H. (2025).** The power of music: impact on EEG signals. *Psychological Research*, 89, 42.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-024-02060-6

**Study Design:**
- 76 healthy subjects (ages 15-26) listening to Egyptian folk vs. classical instrumental music
- EEG with quantitative analysis (QEEG) across all brain regions
- 10-minute protocol: silence → folk music → silence → classical music
- Measured Power Ratio Index (PRI): (delta + theta) / (alpha + beta)

**Key Findings:**
- **Folk music significantly increased slow-wave activity (delta/theta)** in frontal (p<0.001) and occipital (p=0.023) regions
- Folk music associated with "momentary reduction of cognitive capacities by noise effect"
- **Classical instrumental music produced relaxed-state EEG patterns** similar to silence
- Classical music enhanced beta band activity (active concentration) in temporal/frontal regions
- Classical music recruited new brain areas into cognitive processes compared to silence
- **Instrumental classical music enhances reading efficiency and prevents attention distraction**

**Relevance:**
Directly validates using instrumental classical music for programming work. Folk/pop music acts as a distractor (increases slow waves), while classical instrumental maintains optimal cognitive state (preserved fast-wave activity). Supports avoiding vocal music and fast/noisy styles. Key finding: "75% of participants showed better concentration with slow music."

## Music Tempo and Arousal

**Karageorghis, C. I., Terry, P. C., Lane, A. M., Bishop, D. T., & Priest, D. L. (2012).** Music in the exercise domain: A review and synthesis (Part I). *International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology*, 5(1), 44-66.
https://doi.org/10.1080/1750984X.2011.631026

**Key Findings:**
- Tempo "sweet spot" in asynchronous music: approximately 120-140 BPM (except warmup/cooldown)
- **Slower music lowered arousal** (via norepinephrine analysis)
- **Faster music elevated arousal**
- Increasing tempo and/or volume increases athlete's arousal/activation level
- Pre-task music optimizes arousal, facilitates task-relevant imagery, improves performance in simple motoric tasks

**Relevance:**
While focused on sports/exercise (not cognitive work), demonstrates clear link between music tempo and arousal level. Arousal modulation mechanisms likely transfer to cognitive tasks.

**Important Note:** Sports performance is different from cognitive work. Physical arousal needs for athletics may not directly map to optimal cognitive arousal for programming.

## Critical Caveats

### Limited Direct Evidence
Most brainwave entrainment research uses **binaural beats** (requiring headphones), not instrumental music at specific BPMs. The transfer of findings to instrumental music is **theoretical**, not empirically established.

### Individual Differences
Reedijk et al. (2013) found individual dopamine levels (measured via eye blink rates) determined whether binaural beats helped or hurt performance. This suggests "one-size-fits-all" music recommendations may not work universally.

### Mixed Results
Systematic reviews of background music and learning show **inconsistent findings** (de la Mora Velasco & Hirumi, 2020). Effects depend on task type, music characteristics, and individual preferences.

### Context Matters
- Karageorghis & Priest studied **physical exercise**, not cognitive work
- Katahira et al. studied **mental arithmetic**, not programming
- Only Lesiuk (2005) directly studied **software developers**

## This Project's Approach

**What I Did:**
- Generated 130 instrumental music prompts organized by time of day
- Tested 40 prompts (30%) subjectively
- Tracked what helped me focus personally

**What I Didn't Do:**
- Measure brainwaves with EEG
- Conduct controlled experiments
- Validate findings with other programmers
- Test against silence or control conditions

**Honest Assessment:**
The BPM ranges and brainwave targets are informed by research, but applying them to instrumental music (not binaural beats) is theoretical. My ratings reflect subjective experience, not validated science.

**Why This Approach Is Still Valid:**
Lesiuk (2005) showed music helps programmers in real work environments. The specific mechanisms (brainwave entrainment, tempo effects) provide a framework for experimentation, even if not rigorously proven. Personal testing and iteration—the approach used here—is consistent with how Lesiuk's participants learned to use music effectively over time.
