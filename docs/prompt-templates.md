## TEMPLATE A: Chillsynth Jazz Fusion Pattern (from Prompt 5)
**BPM Range:** 105-112
**Time Blocks:** Deep Focus Block 1 & 2
**Core Structure:** Synth pads + repetitive melodic motif + minimal beats + bass drone

### Variation Matrix:

| Variation | Repetitive Element | Rhythmic Foundation | Harmonic Support | Bass Element | Spatial Quality |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 5A | Fender Rhodes motif | boom bap drums | analog synth pads | Juno-60 bass drone | cathedral-like |
| 5B | Wurlitzer pattern | minimal house kicks | modular synth layers | sub bass pulse | vast reverb space |
| 5C | DX7 arpeggio | breakbeat loops | vintage string machine | Moog bass drone | underwater depth |
| 5D | CP-70 electric piano | brushed drums | tape-saturated pads | upright bass pedal | room ambience |
| 5E | Clavinet motif (filtered) | lo-fi drum machine | warm organ swells | 808 bass sustained | cosmic emptiness |
| 5F | Marimba loop (soft mallets) | frame drum pulse | ambient choir pads | sine wave bass | cavern resonance |
| 5G | Vibraphone pattern (bowed) | jazz brushes | Rhodes wash | acoustic bass drone | concert hall |
| 5H | Celeste pattern | minimal techno kick | analog synth clusters | TB-303 bass line | church organ space |
| 5I | Hammered dulcimer loop | tabla minimalism | synthesizer drones | fretless bass | mountain echo |
| 5J | Kalimba sequence | shaker whispers | chillwave pads | electric bass sustain | forest clearing |

### Example Prompts (using template):

**5A - Variation 1:**
```
Vintage Fender Rhodes electric piano motif repeats with hypnotic precision at 108 BPM, anchored by subtle boom bap drum programming in this chillsynth jazz fusion instrumental. Analog synthesizer pads unfold in slow waves across the harmonic background, while Juno-60 bass drones create cathedral-like spatial depth—designed to induce flow state through sonic architecture rather than melody, freeing conscious processing for deep work through sustained theta-gamma coupling.
```

**5B - Variation 2:**
```
Wurlitzer electric piano pattern cycles with metronomic consistency at 110 BPM, supported by minimal house kick and hi-hat in this ambient electronica meditation. Modular synthesizer layers drift as textural atmosphere while sub bass pulses throb in vast reverb space—creating hypnotic scaffold for sustained concentration, where repetitive elements maintain entrainment and spacious production allows theta dominance.
```

## TEMPLATE B: Minimal Afro-House Jazz Pattern (from Prompt 13)
**BPM Range:** 112-118
**Time Blocks:** Deep Focus Block 2, Late Afternoon Push
**Core Structure:** Repetitive melodic percussion + four-on-floor + sub bass + sparse harmonic stabs

### Variation Matrix:

| Variation | Melodic Percussion | House Foundation | Harmonic Stabs | Sub Bass Quality | Cognitive Function |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 13A | balafon pattern | four-on-floor kick | Rhodes stabs | hypnotic throb | external memory |
| 13B | marimba cycle | minimal house | electric piano chords | deep pulse | cognitive scaffold |
| 13C | kora loop | tech house kick | synthesizer stabs | sine wave drone | temporal anchor |
| 13D | xylophone motif | deep house | vibraphone hits | 808 bass sustained | pattern recognition |
| 13E | thumb piano (amplified) | minimal techno | guitar chord stabs | Moog bass drone | rhythmic trance |
| 13F | gamelan metallophone | four-on-floor | vintage organ stabs | sub sine wave | entrainment device |
| 13G | steel pan (dampened) | afro house | DX7 stabs | sub bass pulse | flow state anchor |
| 13H | dulcimer (hammered) | minimal house | clavinet stabs (filtered) | TB-303 bass | theta generator |
| 13I | music box mechanism | deep house | celeste stabs | fretless bass drone | hypnotic cycle |
| 13J | harp (dampened strings) | tech house | prepared piano hits | electric bass sustain | trance scaffold |

### Example Prompts:

**13B - Variation 1:**
```
A marimba pattern repeats with ritual precision over minimal house four-on-floor pulse at 115 BPM, its wooden resonance creating the melodic foundation of this deep house ambient fusion. Sub bass frequencies pulse hypnotically in steady waves while electric piano chord stabs punctuate the arrangement every four bars, treated as texture rather than melody. Music for sustained concentration through rhythmic trance, where the repetitive cycle becomes cognitive scaffold and external timekeeper.
```

**13E - Variation 2:**
```
Amplified thumb piano establishes hypnotic two-note pattern at 116 BPM over minimal techno kick, its metallic overtones creating trance-like texture in this ambient house meditation. Moog synthesizer bass drones in root position while vintage guitar chord stabs appear sparsely in reverb space—arranged to support extended theta access through repetitive minimalism, functioning as rhythmic anchor rather than musical entertainment.
```

## QUICK GENERATION COMMANDS (for Suno):

When you have a successful track, ask Suno to create variations by:

1. **Instrument Swap:** "Create version with [different instrument] instead of [original]"
2. **Tempo Shift:** "Make variation at [+/- 5 BPM]"
3. **Production Aesthetic:** "Generate version with [cassette/vinyl/hi-fi/lo-fi] production"
4. **Spatial Treatment:** "Create variation with deeper reverb space"
5. **Bass Emphasis:** "Make version with more sub bass presence"
6. **Textural Addition:** "Add subtle field recordings in background"
7. **Harmonic Variation:** "Use modal harmony instead of jazz chords"

## SYSTEMATIC EXPANSION PLAN

### Priority 1: Deep Focus Blocks (Need ~80 tracks each)
Based on excellent Prompts 5 and 13, generate:
- 10 variations from Template A (chillsynth pattern)
- 10 variations from Template B (minimal afro-house)
- 20 hybrid combinations
- Total: 40 prompts × 2 blocks = 80 prompts

### Priority 2: Morning Warmup (Need ~40 tracks)
Use gentler versions of successful patterns:
- Lower BPM (92-102)
- More acoustic instruments
- Gradual build structure
- 15-20 unique prompts

### Priority 3: Late Afternoon Push (Need ~40 tracks)
Use energized versions:
- Higher BPM (108-120)
- More rhythmic complexity
- Broken beat variations
- 15-20 unique prompts

### Priority 4: Support Blocks
- Midday Refresh: 10-15 prompts
- Evening Wind-Down: 10-15 prompts

## BATCH GENERATION STRATEGY

**Week 1:** Generate all Deep Focus prompts (Priority 1)
- Day 1-2: Generate 20 variations from Template A
- Day 3-4: Generate 20 variations from Template B
- Day 5: Test during actual work, rate effectiveness

**Week 2:** Generate Morning & Afternoon (Priority 2-3)
- Day 1-2: Morning warmup variations
- Day 3-4: Late afternoon variations
- Day 5: Test and refine

**Week 3:** Fill gaps and generate support blocks
- Create specialized variations for specific tasks
- Generate transitional pieces
- Test complete daily flow

## NAMING CONVENTION FOR CSV

Use this format for Prompt_ID:
- `5A-1`, `5A-2`, `5A-3` = Variations of Template 5A
- `13B-1`, `13B-2`, `13B-3` = Variations of Template 13B
- `HYBRID-5A-13B-1` = Hybrid of both templates

This allows easy tracking of which template/variation is being tested.
